Release history for Dist-Zilla-Util-FileMunge-Simple

{{$NEXT}}
 [00 Major]
 - This is a major set of changes, but mostly forwards compatible.
 - Only a few minor packaging backcompat risks for downstream $VENDORs who
   work by HAND.

 [01 New Functions]
 - A whole bunch of new functions have been added which are more DWIM and
   trying smarter to advoid the horrible black magic. - auto_munge_file now
   the most recommended approach, but supports no laziness overiding.

 [02 Less Black Magic]
 - There's still a rebless trick or two to cast the refs in-place, but they
   should be more stable and less prone to initialization-based errors.

 [03 New Tooling]
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker has taken precedence over Module::Build
 - Dependencies on latest versions are now only recommended, not required.

 [04 New Verson Scheme]
 - 0.y.z -> 1.yyyzzz
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.
